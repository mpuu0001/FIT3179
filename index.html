          <p> Some used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happines, but everyone get a different path to
            happines and we can never getting to
            know the actual feelings of a person. When a time one think a preson is happy, but the one will never know
            whether the person fake happiness.

          <h2>Global Happiness Factors</h2>
          <p>There are 5 factors in regard to gobal happiness, including GDP, social support, freedom to make lfe chiose
            and generosity.
            we can analysis about how these factors are related to each others by playing around with the heatmap.
            Firstly, there is a clear relationship
            between social support, GDP and happiness rate, which means people would be happy to live a developed
            counties where they can make use of their strengths
            to server others or be visible and valuable. Then, we can see that freedom to make
            life decision is the most important factors that influence average happiness. Additionally, the heatmap also
            tell that happy people are more generous which
            means they have a higher inclination to help others. as there is a strong link between feeling happy and
            doing good for the community or the world.
            Lastly, the preceptiones of corruption is amlost irrelavant to happines
            rate of a countryes so I will leave it alone for the next stage of the analysis</p>

          <h2>Global Happiness Assessment</h2>
          <p>Let's view the avgerage rating score of the 4 factors that we discovered in the previous stage. Mainly, the
            world is partioned into 5 regions which are
            Asia, Oceana, Africa, Europe and America. We can view the most balance avgerage socre appearing at the
            region of America. Then Europe comes the next,
            following up with Asia and Oceana. One intreseting fact is that the generosity score is the most strict
            along all countries gobally</p>

          <h2>Global Healthy Life Expectancy</h2>
          <p>How long people is the healthy life expectancy over the world. The lollipo chart illustrates the average
            ages of these four regions we analyse previously.
            Without any surperising that europe is the region where people enjoy the longest life all over the world.
            Next is the America and Oceana where the avgerage
            life expectancy is 66. Then, Aisan has a slightly lower value of an age of 65. Simial to the information we
            obtained from the previous radar chart, African
            people has the lowest avgerage life expectancy of 59. Therefore, we can say thay people tend to live longer
            in a developed regions than developing regions.

            trend of change in a country by click on a bubble,
            and can tell that the majority of countries in the world are getting a lagger happiness rate over the period
            of years, which pattern can also be viewed at
            tha trand of generosity rate, when happy people are tend to be more generous with others.</p>
